#NS VR Challenge!

One of our prof was awesome enough to bring us quality mobile VR gear for the students in our NS Lehman Club. The Catch? you have to make a VR application. Anything!. 

##Project Requirements:

I decided to give the project a try using Untiy3D so the requirements revolve around what you ned to make that work.

- Download Unity. Version 17.2 or newer.
- Android SDK. I got it by installing Android Studio.
- Java SDK Version 1.8 (this was specified by the documentation and I havent tried the latest version).
- Patitence
- Google VR resource assets  for Unity.
- A text editor! Unity makes you download Visual Studio. 
- some knowledge of C# (custom scripts are written in C# unless you are brabe enough to do them in C).
- An android phone running Kit Kat or higher android API (19), and the means of connecting it to your machine via USB.
- Enable developer options in your android device as well as USB debugging. 

---
*Some notes:* Make sure that you have the drivers installed for the device that you will be testing your app on. I used a OnePlus 6 and it was a pain because... OnePlus? 
The drivers for oneplus are on the phone itself and will show once you connect the phone. I spent quite a bit figuring this out. 

##Run:
-The easiest way to run the app by far is to simply download the APK file to your device and install it from there. This was the way that I had to test in the OP6 since it wouldn't be recognized in USB debugging mode. 

-You can run it as a simulation from unity itself. However this isn't always reliable 

##The App
The app is pretty baren and it might or might not be improoved from it's position as a very rough draft. It does what it's supposed to: To be a VR app.
